# Game of Connect Four using Competitive Co-Evolution
Connect 4 is a classic two-player board game that requires a balance between strategy and anticipation. In this project, we delve into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and competitive co-evolution to develop intelligent agents that can play Connect 4 at a high level.  Competitive coevolution is an innovative approach in which artificial intelligence agents evolve in competition with each other, leading to the emergence of advanced strategies.  The project's focus is on discovering ways to enhance artificial intelligence agents' Connect Four playing capability as well as their ability for strategic decision-making. The project uses a competitive co-evolution strategy to improve the AI's success in Connect Four, a two-player abstract strategy game.
Multiple strategies compete against one another in a process known as competitive co-evolution, which enables them to evolve and adapt their strategies over time. The ultimate objective is to develop AI players that can play Connect Four more strategically and successfully, advancing artificial intelligence in relation to board games.

# Requisites
The project was coded in Python 3.11.1 64-bit.
Python libraries required:

1. Numpy: Numpy can installed using the command pip3 install numpy

2. Pygame: Pygame can be installed using the command python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

3. Matplotlib: can be installed using the command python -m pip install -U pip python -m pip install -U matplotlib



# Running the Code
Clone the repository and run the 'game_integration.py' to run the game.
Click on the GUI when the token is red(AI) as it needs a mouse input from the human player so that it can proceed with its turn.
Click the column in which you want to place a token for a yellow token(human player)
'Plot1.py' and 'plot2.py' are used to plot graphs for the results that are stored and used manually.

# Contents
The plot1.py and plot2.py contains code to generate a graph based on the data values provided.
'game_integration.py' contains the code tree representation as an object function related to objects.
'game_mechanics.py' contains most of the game mechanics that are being performed for the GUI and the algorithm.
'connect_four_try_code.py' contains the initial game design which was made as a 2-player game.
A detailed explanation is provided in the dissertation report.
